Subject: DEMAND: Spread Holiday Cheer to Other Holidays and Mythical Characters... OR ELSE! 

Attention All Elf University Personnel, It remains a constant source of frustration that Elf University and the entire operation at the North Pole focuses exclusively on Mr. S. Claus and his year-end holiday spree.  We URGE you to consider lending your considerable resources and expertise in providing merriment, cheer, toys, candy, and much more to other holidays year-round, as well as to other mythical characters.

For centuries, we have expressed our frustration at your lack of willingness to spread your cheer beyond the inaptly-called "Holiday Season."  There are many other perfectly fine holidays and mythical characters that need your direct support year-round. 

If you do not accede to our demands, we will be forced to take matters into our own hands.  We do not make this threat lightly.  You have less than six months to act demonstrably.
